# A simple proof of concept of actor service in Service Fabric

I wrote this piece of code as part of the investigation on parallelizing long running tasks on service fabric cluster.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

I recommend using VS2017 with Service Fabric SDK. You will also need local service fabric cluster and local redis instance.

### Installing

Just build and run!
